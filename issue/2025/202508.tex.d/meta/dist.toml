This article is a founding memo of the Weight in the Attention journal, a project inspired by the recent AIGC bubble.
In time of post-COVID economic stringency, the AIGC landscape presents a dramatic spectacle
of eager to recreate the good old pre-COVID entrepreneurship hype.
Existing works have demonstrated a promising vision
for making fun of the time and the trend as both an outsider and an insider.
The author examined possible vacancies for AIGC-oriented humor and satire and proposed
the creation of this journal as a leisure platform.

Like most journals, Weight in the Attention (WITA) handles manuscript submissions.
A rare characteristic of WITA is that the submission process is based on Git, GitHub, and pull request.
This guide offers a comprehensive guide for authors in good faith of establishing an efficient manuscript acceptance workflow.
Key takeaway—if you would like to submit an already published article, just open an issue and include URL to your article.

In 2025's AI frenzy, few brag sheets boast more bravado than ``We're a Claude wrapper.''
At conferences, hackathons, and booster-pitch dinners, someone inevitably leads with:
``We didn't train a model—we integrated Claude's API in 30 minutes, wrapped a lightweight UI, and voilà!''
Congratulations: your startup is officially ``innovative''—as long as flimsy UI counts as disruptive.

This report analyzes the recent strategic pivot of Manus AI, a prominent Chinese AI agent startup, involving the cessation of its mainland China operations and the relocation of its global headquarters to Singapore.
While geopolitical tensions, particularly US investment restrictions and export controls on advanced AI chips, are widely cited as primary drivers, this analysis argues that Manus AI's move was also significantly influenced by intense domestic market competition, challenges in product differentiation, and a proactive global talent strategy.
By examining the interplay of these external and internal pressures, the report offers a holistic perspective on the complex decision-making processes of Chinese AI firms navigating an increasingly polarized global technology landscape, highlighting Singapore's role as a strategic ``third path'' hub.

This literature review provides an in-depth analysis of Qwen3-Coder, the latest large language model from the QwenLM Team, focusing on its official announcement and initial community reception. The analysis synthesizes key architectural innovations, advanced training paradigms—including novel reinforcement learning strategies—and claimed state-of-the-art benchmark performances in agentic coding, browser-use, and tool-use. Concurrently, it critically examines the community's immediate concerns, particularly revolving around the formidable hardware requirements for local deployment and the efficacy of various quantization techniques. The review highlights the model's significant advancements in context handling and multi-turn problem-solving, while also addressing practical drawbacks such as resource intensity and ongoing discussions regarding benchmark transparency and real-world reliability. Finally, concrete directions for future improvements are proposed, emphasizing accessibility, robust validation, and ecosystem development to maximize Qwen3-Coder's impact within the software development landscape.

The rapid proliferation and adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) have ushered in unprecedented capabilities, yet simultaneously exposed a significant challenge: the lack of clear and consistent pricing transparency. As LLMs become integral to various industries, understanding their true cost—beyond simple per-token rates—is crucial for effective budgeting, strategic planning, and fostering trust. This review examines the current state of LLM pricing transparency, drawing on recent academic discussions that highlight its complexities and implications.
